# About Me
Hi my name is Bob and I am a software engineer that likes to cook. I wanted to keep all my recipes in one place so I made this website to do so. I hope you find something you enjoy here, if so consider sending me a small token of your appreciation in the form of a donation. This website is free to use and also free of any outside advertising. With your support, I would like to keep it that way.
