# Fresh Corn Tortillas
**Makes 12 tortillas**

## Ingredients
* 2 cups gluten free masa harina corn flour
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 1/2 to 2 cups of hot water

## Procedure
1. Mix salt into the masa harina corn flour. Slowly pour the water into the dough to get a good consistency. The dought should be firm and springy when touched, not dry or sticky.
2. Let the dough rest for about an hour, covered with a damp towel.
3. Preheat a griddle or flat surface.
4. Divide the dough into 2-inch balls. Press dough between two pieces of waxed paper, or flatten according to a tortilla press directions, into 6-inch circles.
5. Place flattened dough on a hot griddle or flat surface and cook until the top of the tortilla starts to look cooked, about 1 minute. Flip to the other side and heat for another minute.
