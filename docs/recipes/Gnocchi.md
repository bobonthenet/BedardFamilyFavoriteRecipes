# Gnocchi

::: danger
This recipe is not gluten free. I am hoping to see how it goes using gluten free flour in the near future but in the meantime it should not be considered safe for GF.
:::

::: tip
Shaping the gnocchi takes a bit of practice at first but will quickly become easy once you get the hang of it and is a lot of fun! The dough should also be easy to work with and if it isn't you needed to boil your potatoes longer to soften them more.
:::

## Ingredients
* Egg
* 2 potatoes
* 2 cups all-purpose flour

## Procedure
1. Peel, dice, and boil your potatoes until they are tender, about 15 minutes.
2. Use a potato masher to thoroughly mash the potatoes so that there are no lumps.
3. Combine 1 cup of mashed potatoes, flour and egg in a large bowl. Knead until all ingredients are thoroughly incorporated and dough forms a ball.
4. Divide the ball of dough into 4ths and roll out into long snakes, cut into 1/2" pieces.
5. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
6. While your water is coming to a boil, use a gnocchi board to shape the pieces of dough.
7. Once you have shaped all your gnocchi pieces drop them in the boiling water and use a slotted spoon to remove them as they float to the surface of the pot, about 3 to 5 minutes.
