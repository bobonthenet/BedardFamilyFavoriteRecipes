# Sweet Potato Beef Stew

::: tip
Try not to drink too much of the wine while cooking. Save some for the actual meal.
:::

## Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 2 pounds beef stew meat
* 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 3 medium onions, chopped into bite-sized chunks
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 cups dry red wine
* 2 cups beef broth
* 2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and chopped into bite-sized chunks
* 4 large carrots, peeled and chopped into coins
* 3 bay leaves
* 1 teaspoon dried thyme
* Salt and pepper, to taste

## Procedure
1. Heat the butter in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Dredge the stew meat in the flour. Brown the stew meat, working in three batches, for just a few minutes until the sides of the meat are brown and crisp. Remove meat from pot and set aside.
2. Add in the onions and garlic, and cook until just fragrant and tender, about five minutes.
3. Add in the wine mixture, and scrape the bottom of the pan to deglaze. If cooking in a slow cooker, transfer the wine, beef, and all remaining ingredients in a slow cooker and cook for 4-6 hours on high or 6-8 on low. If cooking on the stove, add in the beef and all remaining ingredients to the Dutch oven, bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 90 minutes to 2 hours, or until the meat is very tender and the gravy is thick and smooth.

::: tip
You can follow the steps right up until the point you would put this in the slow cooker the night before. Then put it in and start the cooker the next morning.
