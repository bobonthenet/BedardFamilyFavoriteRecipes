# Banana Scramble
**Got bananas that are about to go bad and don't want to make banana bread? Want a quick and easy breakfast or brinner? This recipe benefits from bananas as overripe as possible and is super quick to prepare and cook. Family favorite and pretty simple. I usually do not measure out the ingredients and eyeball it, but here are what I feel are the optimal measurements. You can adjust the amount by just doing double the eggs for the amount of bananas and adjusting the rest to your preferences.**

## Ingredients
* 2 bananas
* 4 eggs
* 2 cups almond flour
* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
* 1/2 tablespoon cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon nutmeg
* 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
* Heaping tablespoon of coconut oil

## Procedure
1. In a medium to large mixing bowl, mash the bananas, it's totally fine if they're a bit chunky, does not need to be smooth
2. Add the eggs and whisk together until incorporated together
3. Add the almond flour, whisk again until incorporated
4. Add the vanilla extract and all of the dry spices, feel free to toss in anything else that sounds good, stir it all in
5. Add the coconut oil to your pan of choice, and heat until melted
6. Pour in the banana scramble batter and let it simmer until the edges start hardening a bit
7. Cook pretty much just like scrambled eggs and it should have a slightly moist bread-like consistency when it's ready, if you cook too long it will dry out too much
