# 10 Minute No Chop Keto Chili

::: tip
This chili is pretty good considering how easy and fast it is. I make it in my cast iron. I recommend that if you have more time though to check out one of the other chili recipes on this site.

## Ingredients
* 1 lb lean ground beef (or turkey)
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 1 tsp ground coriander
* 1/2 tsp ground cayenne (optional)

* salt and pepper to taste

## Procedure
1. In a medium saucepan, combine the ground beef and all of the spices.
2. Cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes.
3. When the meat is cooked through, add your salsa.
