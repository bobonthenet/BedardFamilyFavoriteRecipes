# Hamburger Helper Rice
**Super simple instant pot recipe, and even our preschooler loves it. If you enjoy spice, I highly recommend stirring in your favorite hot sauce or sprinkling on some red pepper flakes upon serving.

* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 2 teaspoons onion powder
* 15 oz can tomato sauce
* 3 cups water
* 2 cups white rice, long-grain
* 2 cups cheddar cheese, sharp, shredded

1. Soak the lentils for at least 2 hours
2. Boil the lentils for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, then drain
3. Add the water, rice, tomato sauce, lentils, black pepper, and onion powder
4. Lock the lid in place and seal the steam nozzle
5. Use the default rice setting to cook
6. Natural release the pressure
7. Stir in the cheese
