# Sandwich Bread

:::tip
This recipe pairs really well with a beer cheese dip.

## Ingredients

* 1.5 cups of warm water
* 1 packet of yeast
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tbsp brown sugar
* 1 tbsp butter
* 3-4 cups flour
* course sea salt
* 1/2 cup baking soda
* 9 cups water

## Procedure

1. Add the packet of yeast to the warm water and let sit for 1 minute so the yeast can activate.
2. Add salt, brown sugar, and melted butter to the water. Mix that all together thoroughly.
3. Mix in one cup of flour at a time and continue kneading until the proper texture is reached. The dough should no longer be sticky and will bounce back when pressed. I highly recommend using a stand mixer for this but you can do it by hand.
4. Turn the dough out on a floured surface knead for several minutes by hand and then let the dough rest covered for about 10 minutes.
5. While the dough is resting bring 9 cups of water to a boil and line your baking sheets with parchment paper. One boiling add the baking soda and reduce to a low simmer.
6. Divide the dough into approximately 1/3 cup pieces. Roll into 20-22 inch ropes and form into a pretzel shape. Don't worry if you struggle with this at first, it takes some practice. There are also a lot of good YouTube videos that will show you how to do it.
7. Once all the pretzels have been formed you will add them one at a time to the boiling water for 10 seconds each. Add one pretzel, count to 10, then immediately remove it and place it on a baking sheet.
8. Once all the pretzels have been given their hot bath sprinkle on some salt and put them in the oven for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown.
