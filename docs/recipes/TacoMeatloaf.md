# Taco Meatloaf

::: tip
This is an amazing recipe! Sometimes I leave the red peppers out, I'm not sure which I like best.
:::

## Ingredients
* 1 pound ground chorizo (loose or removed from casings)
* 1 pound ground chuck/beef
* 2 large eggs
* 1/2 cup minced red onion (about 1/2 medium onion)
* 1/2 cup minced red bell pepper (about 1 small)
* 1 cup marinara sauce
* 2-3 cloves of garlic, minced
* 2 tablespoon taco seasoning
* 1/4 teaspoon sea salt
* 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro (stems and all!)
* 1/2 cup almond meal
* 4-ounce can chopped green chilis, not drained
* Optional Garnishes: avocado or guacamole, diced tomatoes or salsa, shredded lettuce or any preferred greens, sliced black olives

## Procedure
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2. In a large bowl, combine ingredients until well-mixed. Using your hands really helps achieve this.
3. On a baking sheet with sides and a piece of parchment paper, form a loaf with the meat mixture.
4. Bake for 60 minutes until internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F (a meat thermometer is one of my most used kitchen gadgets). Remove from oven and let rest for 30 minutes.
5. Slice and serve with optional garnishes.
6. Enjoy!
