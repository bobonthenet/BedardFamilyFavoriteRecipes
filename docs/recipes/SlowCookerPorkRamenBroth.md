# Slow Cooker Pork Ramen Broth

:::tip
The pork used in this recipe makes great sandwiches, do not throw it away! I didn't really care for it in the actual ramen but it is great on its own.
:::

## Ingredients
* 3 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into 3 equal pieces
* Kosher salt
* 2 tablespoons canola oil (if including the optional browning step)
* 1 yellow onion, coarsely chopped
* 6 garlic cloves, chopped
* 1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped
* 8 cups low-sodium chicken broth
* 1 leek, halved lengthwise and coarsely chopped (white and green parts)
* Low-sodium soy sauce, for seasoning
* Sesame and/or chile oil, for seasoning
About 4 green onions, finely chopped (white and pale green parts)

## Procedure
1. Season the pork with salt.
2. Add oil to a castiron skillet and warm until hot. Working in batches if necessary to avoid crowding, add the pork pieces and sear them on the first side without moving them until well browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the pieces and sear on the second side until well browned, 3 to 4 minutes longer. Transfer to a plate and set aside.
3. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the fat from the insert and return the insert to medium-high heat. Add the yellow onion and sear, without stirring, until browned, about 5 minutes. 
4. Stir in the garlic, ginger, and 1 cup of the broth and deglaze the insert, stirring and scraping up any browned bits from the insert bottom, then let simmer for 1 minute.
5. Transfer all ingredients to a slow cooker, add the leek, the remaining 7 cups of broth, and stir to combine. Combine the pork, yellow onion, garlic, ginger, leek, and broth in the slow cooker. Cover and cook on the low-heat setting for 8 hours. The pork should be very tender and the broth should be fragrant.
6. After everything has finished in the slow cooker remove the pork and set aside, this can be used later for whatever you want including your ramen. Strain broth into storage containers or directly into bowls for serving.
