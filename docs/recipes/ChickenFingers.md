::: tip
Be extra careful to not let the oil get too hot! I highly recommend an IR thermometer.

## Ingredients
* 1 lb chicken breasts
* 2-3 cups oil of choice (for frying)

### Dry Ingredients
* 1 cup Bob’s Red Mill Corn Flour
* ½ cup Bob’s Red Mill Tapioca Starch
* ¼ tsp baking powder
* ½ tsp salt
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tsp onion powder
* Fresh cracked black pepper

### Wet Ingredients
* 2 eggs
* ¼ cup dairy or non-dairy milk
* 1 tbsp mustard
* ¼ tsp salt

## Procedure
1. Start with two bowls.  Combine the dry ingredients in one, and the wet ingredients in the other.  Keep these ingredients separate.  Make sure your chicken is at room temperature before cooking; this will help it cook evenly.  Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and slice into fingers, about ¾” wide.  Lightly season with salt and pepper.  Seasoning every layer ensures that our final product won’t be bland.
2. Preheat a skillet that distributes heat really well, like a cast iron or dutch oven, with the oil over medium heat.
3. While that goes, start the coating process.  Going one at a time, dredge each chicken finger with its first layer of dry ingredients.  This first layer will help the coating to stick when they’re finished cooking.  Place in the egg mixture for the first time, then go back into the dry mixture.  When nicely coated, add back into the egg mixture for the second time, and then back into the dry mixture for the third and final time.  The full process is dry, wet, dry, wet, dry!  This layering process will help give our chicken fingers an incredible crunch.  Repeat this process for each piece and let them sit in the coating for a few minutes before frying.
4. When the oil is ready, add a few fingers at a time and cook for 3-4 minutes per side.  They should be beautifully golden brown.  Make sure the heat isn’t too high; we don’t want a burned outside and raw inside.  Immediately season with some salt and let them momentarily cool before serving.
