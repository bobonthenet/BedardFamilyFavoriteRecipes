# Instant Pot Yogurt

## Timing
* **Total time:** 12 hours 2 minutes
* **Prep time:** 2 minutes
* **Cook time:** 8 hours
* **Refrigerate:** 4 hours

:::tip
* Instead of using the Instant Pot lid, I recommend using a glass lid. The Instant Pot lid can hold a lot of smells, and those will make their way into your yogurt if you don't clean the lid verrrry thoroughly. You can use the lid, but you need to make sure all smell remnants are gone.
* Your Instant Pot should be clean and sterile before making your yogurt.

## Ingredients
* 1 container of Ultra-filtered or Ultra Pasteurized Milk (do NOT substitute, Fairlife is the one that we have used)
* 2 tablespoons of yogurt with live active cultures
* 1 can of sweetened condensed milk (our can was 14 oz, but you can use however much you want to control sweetness)
* Instant Pot with Yogurt function

## Procedure
1. Combine 1/2 cup of milk with the yogurt starter until they are completely combined. If they are not completely combined, it could result in a grainy yogurt.
2. Add sweetened condensed milk to the Instant Pot with 1 cup of milk, and whisk together until completely combined.
3. Add in the rest of the milk and starter/milk mixture. Whisk completely.
4. Place the glass lid on (or lock down your lid if you chose to use your Instant Pot lid)
5. Press the Yogurt button and ensure that it is on the NORMAL setting, not LESS or MORE. Use the plus and minus buttons to select a time. 8-10 hours is ideal. We do 8 hours for Fairlife milk. The longer you "incubate", or let it sit, the more tart it will be. Some people incubate up to 24 hours. The Instant Pot will start counting UP, not down, like when pressure cooking.
6. After the 8-10 hours are up, take the pot out of the Instant Pot, cover it with a lid, plastic wrap, or foil, and refrigerate for 8 hours, or overnight. Do not stir or disturb. The consistency after incubation will be almost exactly the consistency after refrigeration, it won't thicken much more, so if it is not set enough for you, continue incubation for another couple hours.
7. If you would like a super thick consistency like greek yogurt, use a yogurt strainer and strain to your desired consistency after chilling.
8. After refrigeration, you can mix it up and transfer to a separate container or containers. (we use small plastic Tupperware-like containers, but you can use jars, or one single large container, it's totally up to you)
9. Enjoy plain (it's really good by itself), or with your choice of sweetener/fruit/granola/etc.
