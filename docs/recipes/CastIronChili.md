# Cast Iron Chili

::: tip
This is my favorite chili recipe! I recently tried it in the slow cooker but it wasn't as good. I think maybe it just needed more time so I'll be trying again soon.
:::

## Ingredients
* 2 lbs ground bison, beef, or turkey
* 4 cups cooked beans (kidney, pinto, red, etc.)
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 3 cans (14.5 oz.) diced tomatoes
* 2 tablespoons oil
* 1 tablespoon flour (I used gluten free, but wheat flour is fine, too)
* 1 tablespoon chili powder
* 2 teaspoons granulated garlic
* 2 teaspoons black pepper
* 2 bay leaves

## Procedure
Heat your cast iron dutch oven on medium heat, and add 1 tablespoon of oil to the pan. When the oil is hot and shimmering, toss in your onions.

Aromatics and ground bison
One of the keys to developing flavor for chili is to pair sweetness with salt. The sweetness comes from caramelizing your onions before adding liquids. Because the onions and celery will continue to cook as the meat browns, I like to give them a 5-6 minute head start.

Stir the aromatics around as they cook to avoid scorching, and then add the ground meat. Brown the meat, stirring every minute or two. This will take around 10 minutes.

Once the meat is browned, add another tablespoon of oil, 1 tablespoon of kosher salt, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, and the flour, chili powder, and granulated garlic (NOTE: I use kosher salt because it's what I have in a bowl next to my stove. If you're using table salt, cut quantities in half).


Always taste your chili and re-season as necessary
Cook the spices (in the meat and aromatics) for about a minute to release their oils, and then add the beans, diced tomatoes, and bay leaves. Stir things around once more, and then simmer on low heat for 30 minutes to 3 hoursâ€”depending on how hungry you are. Stir it every 10 minutes or so while is simmers to avoid burning.

The longer it simmers, the better. As your chili simmers, taste it! You want the beans to soak up as much flavor as they can, since this makes each bite of chili more balanced once it hits the spoon. As the beans soak up flavor from the surrounding liquid, you'll want to add more salt and seasonings.

If the chili doesn't delight your palate with flavor upon tasting, add salt until it does. If you prefer more heat, add black pepper (NOTE: pepper takes some time to release into the dish, so wait 20 minutes after adding pepper to taste for heat). If you'd like a little smoke, add a smokey hot sauce like Uncle Brutha's (which, of course, will add heat, too).

As mentioned above, you'd be silly not to serve this chili with some cast iron skillet corn bread. We like to put it over noodles or rice, and it's best served with fresh chopped onions and grated cheese.

## Clean up

Scrub your dutch oven clean with a non-abrasive cleaning pad and hot water. If you don't want to dirty your sponge, or if your sponge is full of soap, you can use a plastic mesh produce bag (like for  onions or citrus) and throw it away when you're finished.

Once clean, dry your dutch oven with heat on the stovetop or in the oven (on 250 degrees F). Once it is dry, oil the dutch oven all over and let it cool. Cast iron should always be put away shiny with oil!
