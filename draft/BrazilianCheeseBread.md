* 1 tsp Garlic powder
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 egg
* 2/3 cup unsweetened original almond milk

## Procedure
1. Preheat oven to 400 F. Spray the mini muffin pans with olive oil lightly so the muffins do not stick.
2. Mix together all the above ingredients in a bowl really well.
3. Pour that mixture into the prepared muffin tin 3/4 of the way.
4. Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes. Take out and allow to cool for a few minutes. Enjoy warm!
